# Peek Game Engine

This is a re-write/re-implementation of Glass, my old engine. I'm hoping this will be not only useful, but fast enough to be usable outside of a few small projects. Wish me luck!

# Why Peek?

The name "Peek" emphasises the main feature of the engine: being able to peek at anything inside the engine. Since you write code in the same language that the engine is written, you can see how the engine's internals work!

# Modules?

Modules are just bits of code that are completely optional. They can be turned on and off by choice at the beginning. Once a module is initialized it can't be turned off! Modules are static classes, so you can't have two 'instances' of a module.
